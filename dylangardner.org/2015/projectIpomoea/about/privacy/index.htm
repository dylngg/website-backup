					<p>Lets be honest. I don't track you, you don't track me... Cool? If you need some reassurance, here's why I don't want to track you.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>It's more fun dreaming about who visits my site than actually knowing.</li>
						<li>I respect your wishes to not be known.</li>
						<li>There is no point for me to know.</li>
						<li>With Goverments, Companies and Hackers tracking you, Privacy has become a luxury. I want to provide you with this when you visit. </li>
						<li>I don't want google tracking you even if you aren't on their site. (<a href="http://donttrack.us/">Google Ads</a>)</li>
						<li>I really don't want your information or want to sell it. (You're not useless, I just don't believe in companies using your data for $)</li>
						<li>I hate ads with a burning passion so, why would I help people give ads to you and me?</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<p>If you don't understand all this, just search "does google track me" or want to know about governments tracking you go <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/7/9/5880403/13-ways-the-nsa-spies-on-us">here.</a></p>

					<p>Questions that I think you might want to know. (Privacy Questions) </p>
						<ol>
							<li>Are you 100% sure that you're not tracking me?</li>
								<p id="indent">Yes. If I ever decide against this, I will put up a huge banner and allow you to opt out.</p>
							<li>Are you ever going to have ads? </li>
								<p id="indent">No. I hate ads with a burning passion. This isn't even a business. (hence the .org)</p>
							<li>Anything else?</li>
								<p id="indent">Nope. Click dylangardner at the top to go home.</p>
