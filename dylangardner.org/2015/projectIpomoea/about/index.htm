				<div class="about">
					<p>It's you again... I am Dylan Gardner. You probably know a lot about me considering you went here. However, If you magically stumbled upon this place and are wondering about this mysterious, cool, weird, awesome, amazing, awe-inspiring, awful, awing, magnificent, brilliant, excellent, grand, impressive, swanky, intense, wonderful, overwhelming, impressive, unusual guy... Go <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">here.</a> If you want to know about the guy who made this site... Well. You're here!</p>
				</div>
			<h1 class="intro">Who?</h1>
				<div class="about">
					<p>Dylan likes to sit at home and code. He spends his time learning more code, building projects, finding cool designs and designing stuff. His designs are known to only himself and he hopes he can make designing or coding his career. He loves his computer with a undescribable passion and hopes no harm comes to it. His tech stuff includes a basic Dell Inspiron 15 Laptop, a mouse, a camera and his archenemy, Windows 8. He prefers coding on the linux side(Ubuntu), however most of the world doesn't. If could afford a mac, he'd most definitely have a mac. He uses Adobe Illustrator and an awesome text editor called <a href="http://brackets.io/">Adobe Brackets</a> to design and code.  Lastly, He is of the age of 15 and currently resides on a wonderful and awful planet called Earth.</p>
